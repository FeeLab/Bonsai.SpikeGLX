# Bonsai - SpikeGLX
**Bonsai.SpikeGLX** is a [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) package for interfacing with the [SpikeGLX](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/) recording software for [Neuropixels](https://www.neuropixels.org/) probes. 

## Description
**Bonsai.SpikeGLX** is designed to allow integration of SpikeGLX recordings into Bonsai workflows. This package provides the ability to 
- stream neural and non-neural data from SpikeGLX into Bonsai in real-time,
- set digital outputs on an NI device in use by SpikeGLX, and
- start and stop SpikeGLX recordings.
